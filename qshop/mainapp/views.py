# Let's implement CRUD operations for Carousel Image using Class based views.

# Class Based Views are declarative methods to implement views.
# Because of OOPs, the programming style is very abstract i.e., implementation details
# are hidden. 
# These views, even though less detailed in readability, improves abstraction and 
# prevents Re-inventing the wheel, as classes can be inherited and their functionalities
# extended.
    # In Django, realizing the most common usages of request-response scenarios,
    # generic Class Based Views (CBVs) were created.
    # For Inserting new records of the given model into DB, 
        # 1. CreateView (Create)
    # For Querying all records of the given model from DB,
        # 2. ListView   (Read)
    # For Querying a specific record from the given model using pk,
        # 3. DetailView (Read)
    # For Updating or editing a specific record using pk,
        # 4. UpdateView (Update)
    # For Deleting a specific record using pk,
        # 5. DeleteView (Delete)
